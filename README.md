## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Jorge (Alex) Zúñiga**, an engineer and musician exploring how **technology shapes the way we create and experience sound**.  
I’m currently a **DSP Software Engineer at Yamaha Corporation** in Japan, where I develop and optimize real-time audio effects for professional mixing consoles.  

My background blends **electronics, signal processing, and creative coding**, and my goal is to design tools that make high-quality sound creation more expressive and accessible.  

I’m applying to **PhD programs in Music Technology** in the U.S., aiming to research real-time sound synthesis, physical modeling, and intelligent audio systems that bridge artistry and engineering.

## ☕ Hobbies & Interests

When I’m not programming or experimenting with sound, you’ll probably find me:  
- Playing **guitar** or **drums**, lately getting deep into **jazz** (after years of rock and blues).  
- Brewing **coffee** with my moka pot or pour-over setup — daily ritual, no exceptions.  
- Watching classic **movies** or reading books that inspire ideas for sound design and storytelling.
